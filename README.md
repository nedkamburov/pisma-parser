# Document Parser
Tool developed with NodeJS and Electron to parse through text documents.

The Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds (BSPB) embarked on a project to map out every construction site inside or near a protected zone. This is part of the [EU programme Natura 2000](bspb.org/en/natura.html) to conserve natural habitats. I volunteered to help by creating a (NodeJS) tool to automate the task of going through thousands of Bulgarian documents and sieve through the necessary information.
